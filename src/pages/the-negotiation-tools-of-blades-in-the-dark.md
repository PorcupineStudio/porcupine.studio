There is that thing in roleplaying games that D. Vincent Baker talks
about where things aren't real until there is consensus at the
table. "Really? Orks this far north?"

While all rules in all ttrpgs direct the onversation towards
consensus, John Harper has packed Blades in the Dark with tools for
playing explicitely with it and for reaching consensus in high tension
stories quickly and efficiently

Stress is a formal negotiating currency with rules that constrain both
parties (player and GM) in an economic mechanism that drives towards
certain kinds of stories.

* Flashbacks let you create consensus where there was none established
  about what happened in the past
* Resistance gives players limited power to avoid consequences without
  a big negotiation or whatever "If I had known that I'd have done
  this"
* Position and effect create efficient shorthand (and convinient
  schelling point) for coming to an easy consensus after a roll
* There are a number of fantastic ways to visualize things that are
  otherwise invisible helping PCs and GM maintain consensus without GM
  fiat
  * Clocks
  * Heat
  * Explicit limits on downtime activities
  * Entanglements

Not only that, it comes with a setting that is more integrated than
any other game that is coming to mind right now.
