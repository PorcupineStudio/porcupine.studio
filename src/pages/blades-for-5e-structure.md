The Forged in the Dark structure

Free Play -> Engagemenet Roll
    ^              |
    |              v
Downtime   <-  The Score

For D&D we might update that to

Free Play -> The Embark roll
    ^     \        |
    |  Long Rest   |
    |       \      v
Downtime  <- The Adventure

Free play is what we do in D&D all the time already.

The adventure will need to have some bounds put on it (probably by
adding some resource that is consumed by adventure), the downtime
actions will have to be written. The embark roll would need to be
designed. (oh looks like 5e does have downtime activities, but limits
would need to be put on them)

There will probably need to be some sort of restricted downtime as
well, for when the party needs a downtime without making it back to
the town or safely out of the dungeon or whatever.

Restricted downtime replaces the long rest
